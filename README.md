# Music-Recommendation-System-Using-Association-Rules

## Introduction

This project focuses on developing a recommendation system for a popular music website, utilizing association rule learning to suggest songs to customers based on their previous purchases and the preferences of other users with similar tastes. The dataset includes information about the songs downloaded by customers, along with the artists' names, and demographic details of the users such as gender and country, although the latter two will not be utilized in this analysis.

## Objectives

- Process the dataset to ensure compatibility with association rule mining techniques.
- Create a transactions dataset representing users and their downloaded songs to identify patterns and preferences.
- Apply association rule mining to discover relationships between artists and songs that users download together.
- Suggest songs to users based on the identified rules, enhancing user experience through personalized recommendations.

## Data Source

The dataset is sourced from `music.csv`, containing records of songs downloaded by users from the website. It captures the artist's name associated with each download and includes user demographics such as gender and country, though the analysis will focus solely on the artists and songs.

## Methodology

- Data Preprocessing: Read the dataset into a dataframe, converting all variables to factors. Remove entries with unknown artists to ensure data quality.
- Transactions Creation: Convert the cleaned dataframe into a transactions dataset to model user preferences and song downloads effectively.
- Association Rules: Use the Apriori algorithm to find association rules among the downloaded songs with a focus on support, confidence, and lift metrics to determine strong rules.
- Recommendation: Based on the rules, recommend songs to users when they download a song, or show interest in specific artists or songs, improving the overall user experience.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- R or Python programming languages
- Libraries and packages such as `arules` in R or `mlxtend` / `apyori`in Python for association rules
- Data manipulation tools like `dplyr` in R or `pandas` in Python

## Expected Outcomes

- Identify popular artists and songs that are frequently downloaded together by a significant portion of users.
- Generate a list of association rules indicating which songs or artists are likely to be downloaded together, with metrics like support, confidence, and lift guiding the recommendation logic.
- Enhance the music recommendation system, offering users personalized suggestions and promoting a more engaging user experience.
